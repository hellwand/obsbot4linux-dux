# Release guard: the commit to release must already be green as a pull request. Fails, with the
# reason, unless SHA has a check run "required" from a pull_request run of .github/workflows/ci.yml
# and the newest such check run completed with success. Main moves only by a fast-forward push of a
# green pull request head, so the tagged commit is that head and carries the check.
# A "required" job of another workflow or event (an old push run) does not count.
#
# Usage: release-green.sh SHA     env: GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GH_TOKEN (checks: read, actions: read)
# release.yml runs it on a tag push and, as a dry run that publishes nothing, on workflow_dispatch.
